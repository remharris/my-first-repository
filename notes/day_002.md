1. Hyperlinks
  - Use the `a` tag (anchor tag) in the following way:

    ```html
    <a href="https://github.com/remharris">My Github Repo</a>
    ```

    It will then form a clickable link with the words 'My Github Repo', which will go to the URL `https://github.com/remharris`.

  - If you prefer the link to pop out into a blank tab or window (whatever the user's browser is set to do), you add the attribute `target` and set it equal to `_blank`

    ```html
    <a href="https://github.com/remharris" target="_blank">My Github Repo</a>
    ```

2. "Useless tags": `<div>` and `<span>` (blank canvases)
  - The tag `<div>` is an empty **block** type tag.  It doesn't do anything special except:
    - It tries to grow to the full width of whatever tag it is inside of
    - It breaks to a new line after the content it contains
    - It tries to grow only to the height of the content it contains  
    - In fact, that's the definition of a block element.  Many of the elements we use are already block elements, like `<h1>` tags, for example.
    - Block elements gracefully accept padding, borders, and margin, without complaint.

  - The tag `<span>` in an empty **inline** type tag.  It doesn't do anything special except:
    - It tries to be the precise height of the content it wraps
    - It tries to be the precise width of the content it wraps
    - If it is placed inside a block of other inline elements (for example, text), it will just be part of the flow
    - We've seen an example of this in anchor tags (`<a>` above)
    - An inconvenient example of this type of tag is the image tag (`<img>`)
    - Inline elements generally take left and right padding, borders, and margin rules gracefully

  - As a note: you can force any element to act as block or as an inline by specifying the display property on it's style:

    ```css
    img {
      display: block; /* will now act blocky, cool cool */
    }

    h3 {
      display: inline; /* WTF are you doing? */
    }
    ```

3. Lists
  - Sometimes you wanna list things in order.  There are two types of lists:
  - Unordered Lists
    ```html
    <ul>
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>Three</li>
    </ul>
    ```
    This will show up as:
      - One
      - Two
      - Three

  - Ordered Lists
    ```html
    <ol>
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>Three</li>
    </ol>
    ```
    This will show up as:
      1. One
      2. Two
      3. Three

    - List elements are given by the `<li>` tag.  You don't need to supply numbers, it'll do it for you are in an ordered list.

4. Tables
  - Sometimes lists aren't enough, we need to display information in TABULAR FORM.

    ```html
    <table>
      <thead>
        <th></th>
        <th>Heading One</th>
        <th>Heading Two</th>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <th>2006</th>
        <td>1500 units</td>
        <td>2300 units</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    ```

    - The whole table needs to be wrapped in a `<table>` tag.
    - The header for the table needs to be wrapped in a `<thead>` tag.
    - Any cell which acts as the label for that row or column should get a `<th>` tag
    - Any cell which just contains data should get a `<td>` tag
