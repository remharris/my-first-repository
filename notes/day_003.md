1. Some styling bits:
  - Sizes come in all flavors:
    - `px` is common, it means pixels
    - `%` is used a lot with widths, since sometimes you want things to be, say, half of the width of the parent.  

      ```html
      <div class="outer-element">
        <div class="inner-element">
          Blah-blah-blah
        </div>
        <div class="inner-element">
          Blah-blah-other blah
        </div>
      </div>
      ```

      ```css
      .outer-element {
        width: 400px;
      }
      .inner-element {
        width: 50%; /* now 2 children can live side by side */
      }
      ```
    - `em` and `rem` refer to the current font size, or the font size on the `html` tag, respectively.  When you write `1.7em`, you mean the size should be the calculation of `1.7 * current_font_size`
    - There's also things like `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax` which have to do with the current size of the window.

  - Selector types:
    - So far we've seen styling done on tags.

      ```css
      h1 { border: 1px solid blue; }
      p { font-size: 200px; }
      ```

      The disadvantage to this is that EVERY tag with the same name now has to look identical.  Maybe we want only 3 paragraphs to have `font-size` of `200px`.  To accomplish this we can use `class` names.

      ```html
      <p class="big-words">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
      </p>
      ```

      The above paragraph has an attribute known as `class`, which is used for styling.  The class name has to be a string of characters, possibly with hyphens or underscores.  E.g. `box__highlight` is ok, `purple-iconoclast` is ok, but `joey!frizzle` is not ok.

      If you set `class` equal to multiple strings with spaces, it actually applies multiple styles to the same tag.  

      ```html
      <div class="highlight pull-right flip-on-hover">
      </div>
      ```

      The `div` above will be styled by `.highlight`, `.pull-right`, and `.flip-on-hover`.  So in CSS, we take the class name and prepent a `.`, so if `class="red"`, then the style rule is `.red {}`.
    - Likewise, we can style by ID.  So if an element has an attribute of `id`, for example `id="big-important-thing"`, we can write a style rule of `#big-important-thing`

2. Forms
  - Labels: if a label has a `for="something"` attribute, and a input has a `id="something"` attribute, clicking on the label will activate the input as the focus
  - Inputs: `input` is a self closing tag.  You don't need `</input>`, in fact it's bad.
  - Inputs have a type.  It tells the browser what kind of input to expect.  Examples are:
    - `text` (for text)
    - `number` (for numbers)
    - `email` (for email, with bonus VALIDATION on badly formed email addresses)
  - `textarea` is a fancy type of input.  You don't do `<input type='textarea'>`, rather it's it's own tag type.
  - Inputs and Labels are both in-line elements (like `<span>`), so you'll need to change that if you want them to cascade vertically.
