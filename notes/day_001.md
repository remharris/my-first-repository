1. Some Terminal Basics:
  - The command `ls` lists contents of a directory:

    ```bash
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    ~ $
    ```
  - The command `cd` changes a directory:

    ```bash
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    ~ $ cd directory_one
    directory_one $ ls
    subdirectory_one  subdirectory_two
    file_two.txt      file_three.txt
    directory_one $
    ```

    We can use `..` to go up a level:

    ```bash
    directory_one $ cd ..
    ~ $
    ```

    And we can go up or down as many levels as we like:

    ```bash
    ~ $ cd directory_one/subdirectory_one
    subdirectory_one $ cd ../..
    ~ $
    ```

  - The command `mkdir` makes a brand new directory:

    ```bash
    ~ $ mkdir webdev
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    webdev
    ~ $ cd webdev
    webdev $ cd ..
    ~ $
    ```

  - In addition to `..` meaning "up a path level", `.` means the current level, and `~` means home:

    ```bash
    ~ $ cd directory_one/subdirectory_two
    subdirectory_two $ cd .
    subdirectory_two $ cd ~
    ~ $
    ```

  - The command `touch` can be used to create a new file, or many new files:

    ```bash
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    ~ $ touch index.html
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    index.html
    ~ $ touch index.css index.js cat.jpg
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    index.html        index.css
    index.js          cat.jpg
    ~ $
    ```

2. Some `HTML` basics:  

  - Tags:  A tag is a combination of some word plus the symbols `<` and `>`.  For example, there are tags below for `body`, `p`, and `span`.

    ```html
    <body>
      <p>This is some <span>text</span>.</p>
    </body>
    ```

    Many tags have an associated closing tag, which is the same word used in the original tag, following the forward slash (`/`) symbol.  Above you can see `<span>` and `</span>`, for example.

    Some tags don't need a closing tag, and we call those _self closing tags_.  An example of a self closing tag is an image tag (`<img>`) or a break line tag (`<br>`).

  - Minimum structure: Every document must have a `html` tag, and in it there must be `head` and `body` tags.  They always look like this:

    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <!-- stuff the browser needs to know goes here -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- stuff the user should see goes here -->
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

  - Semantic tags: In addition to tags that affect the formatting in the browser (e.g. `h1`, `p`, `a`, etc.) there are tags that are meant to convey semantic meaning to both programmers as well as screen readers (for those that have difficulty using a standard browser, for example because they are visually challenged).  Some examples of these tags are: `section`, `article`, `aside`, `header` (different than `head`), `footer`, `nav`, and many more.  

  - Style sheets: You are allowed to write style directives directly inside the HTML document, between `style` tags contained in the `head` section of the document, but you're also allowed to keep the style directives separate.  The way we do this is by using a link tag in the `head`, linking into our document an external file, called a style sheet.

    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/awesome_colors.css">
      </head>
      <body>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    This will attempt to load any style directives contained in the `stylesheets` subfolder, from a file called `awesome_colors.css`.
