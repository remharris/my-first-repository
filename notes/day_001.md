1. Some Terminal Basics:

  - The command `ls` lists contents of a directory:

    ```bash
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    ~ $
    ```
  - The command `cd` changes a directory:

    ```bash
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    ~ $ cd directory_one
    directory_one $ ls
    subdirectory_one  subdirectory_two
    file_two.txt      file_three.txt
    directory_one $
    ```

    We can use `..` to go up a level:

    ```bash
    directory_one $ cd ..
    ~ $
    ```

    And we can go up or down as many levels as we like:

    ```bash
    ~ $ cd directory_one/subdirectory_one
    subdirectory_one $ cd ../..
    ~ $
    ```

  - The command `mkdir` makes a brand new directory:

    ```bash
    ~ $ mkdir webdev
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    webdev
    ~ $ cd webdev
    webdev $ cd ..
    ~ $
    ```

  - In addition to `..` meaning "up a path level", `.` means the current level, and `~` means home:

    ```bash
    ~ $ cd directory_one/subdirectory_two
    subdirectory_two $ cd .
    subdirectory_two $ cd ~
    ~ $
    ```

  - The command `touch` can be used to create a new file, or many new files:

    ```bash
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    ~ $ touch index.html
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    index.html
    ~ $ touch index.css index.js cat.jpg
    ~ $ ls
    directory_one     directory_two
    directory_three   file_one.txt
    index.html        index.css
    index.js          cat.jpg
    ~ $
    ```

2. Some `HTML` basics:  

  - Tags:  A tag is a combination of some word plus the symbols `<` and `>`.  For example, there are tags below for `body`, `p`, and `span`.

    ```html
    <body>
      <p>This is some <span>text</span>.</p>
    </body>
    ```

    Many tags have an associated closing tag, which is the same word used in the original tag, following the forward slash (`/`) symbol.  Above you can see `<span>` and `</span>`, for example.

    Some tags don't need a closing tag, and we call those _self closing tags_.  An example of a self closing tag is an image tag (`<img>`) or a break line tag (`<br>`).

  - Minimum structure: Every document must have a `html` tag, and in it there must be `head` and `body` tags.  They always look like this:

    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <!-- stuff the browser needs to know goes here -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- stuff the user should see goes here -->
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

  - Semantic tags: In addition to tags that affect the formatting in the browser (e.g. `h1`, `p`, `a`, etc.) there are tags that are meant to convey semantic meaning to both programmers as well as screen readers (for those that have difficulty using a standard browser, for example because they are visually challenged).  Some examples of these tags are: `section`, `article`, `aside`, `header` (different than `head`), `footer`, `nav`, and many more.  

  - Attributes and values: We're also able to attach extra information to a particular tag.

  ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
    <img src="cat.jpg" alt="Groovy picture of a cat.">
  ```

    In the two tags above, we have two attributes, each with their own set values.

      - The `script` tag has an attribute of `type`, which is set to `text/javascript`
      - The `script` tag has an attribute of `src`, which is set to `app.js`
      - The `img` tag also has an attribute of `src`, which is set to `cat.jpg`
      - Lastly the `img` tag has an attribute of `alt`, which is set to `Groovy picture of a cat.`

    In all cases above, the attribute corresponds to some amount of functionality the tag has.  An external JavaScript script needs to specify the "source" of the file to use, as does the image.  An image will prefer some text to display if there is a problem loading the image.  All of these are provided by attributes and their values.

  - Style sheets: You are allowed to write style directives directly inside the HTML document, between `style` tags contained in the `head` section of the document, but you're also allowed to keep the style directives separate.  The way we do this is by using a link tag in the `head`, linking into our document an external file, called a style sheet.

    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/awesome_colors.css">
      </head>
      <body>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    This will attempt to load any style directives contained in the `stylesheets` subfolder, from a file called `awesome_colors.css`.

3. Some styling basics:  

    When we want our web page to look different from "browser stock", we need to tell the browser how to display certain elements:

    ```html
    <section>
      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>Content content content content....</p>
      <h4>Subtitle</h4>
      <p>Much more content content content....</p>
    </section>
    ```

    In the example above, we have two (different) headers and two paragraphs.  They are all contained in a section tag.  We have some options for ways we might change the style of a particular element above.

  - Inline styling.  With inline styling we add a new attribute, `style` to a tag, and then assign to it a value equal to the changes we want to make:

    ```html
    <h3 style="background-color: orange; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;">
      Title of this section
    </h3>
    ```

    The above `h3` tag will have its contained text over orange, with underlining, and will appear at a size of twenty-four vertical pixels.  

    Inline styles are fine, but can feel cumbersome when we write our HTML.  There are better ways, for now.

  - Internal style directives.  We can add `style` tags to the `head` section.  Anything between them will be applied to the webpage, based on matching selectors to the elements in the page.

    ```html
    <head>
      <style>
        body {
          background-color: green;
          color: orange;
        }
        h3 { color: white; }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>Booga booga booga...</p>
    </body>
    ```

    In the above example, the two style directives are on things matching `body`, and things matching `h3`.  The whole body will have a background color of green.  Anything in the body will have a text color of orange, unless it is in an `h3` tag, in which case the font color will be white.

    We will learn many rules about styling, but for now, we can use tag names to create directives.

      - Directives must always be of the form `some-property-name: intended-value;`
      - Also, they must always be contained between curly braces (`{` and `}`)  

  - External style sheets: These should be named `something.css`, where the CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  We link these in the `head` section as follows:

    ```html
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/some-directory/something.css">
    </head>
    ```

    This works exactly like the directives between the `style` tags, except there is no style tag necessary.  You just write your directives in the CSS file, and it gets imported by the `link` tag for you.

    ```css
    body { /* comments look like this */
      background: steelblue;
      width: 480px;
      padding: 1rem;
    }
    ```

  - Common properties:
      - `width` and `height`: these commonly use units `px` (pixels), `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`
      - `margin`, `border`, and `padding`: read about the [box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model)
      - `background-color` and `color`: often values are `#***` or `#******` (hex colors), but `rgba(r, g, b, a)` (RGB with Alpha) are used a fair amount, too
