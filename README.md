## Day One

1. Learn terminal basics
  - `cd` changes a directory (e.g. `cd webdev` puts us in the `webdev` directory)
  - `ls` lists contents of a directory
  -`mkdir` makes a brand new directory (e.g. `mkdir webdev` made the `webdev`)
  - There are two "path" shortcuts `.` is current directory and `..` is the directory above current. (e.g. if we are in `Users/myname/one/two`, `.` refers to `Users/myname/one/two`, and `..` refers to `Users/myname/one` and `../..` refers to `Users/myname`
